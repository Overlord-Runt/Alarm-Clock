# Alarm Clock

Hello\
this is my alarm clock.\
its gonna fuction just like a normal alarm clock, with the difference being that it also opens my curtains every morning so I dont have to keep waking up in the dark.\

It will use a stepper motor to do this with an esp to be the clock. It will have a nice interactive UI on an ssd1306 oled screen and  can be turned off with either a motion sensor or a big red button(I havent decided)
